			<p style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; "> Seattle's Best Coffee LLC is an American coffee retailer and wholesaler based in Seattle, Washington. Since 2003, they have been a subsidiary of American coffeehouse chain Starbucks. Seattle's Best Coffee has retail stores and grocery sub-stores in 20 states and provinces and the District of Columbia. Sub-stores can also be found at many other businesses and college campuses, including JCPenney and Subway restaurants.

			Seattle's Best Coffee is generally cheaper than that of its parent, and is marketed as more of a working class coffee compared to the upmarket Starbucks. </p>

			<p style="font-family: arial;  text-align: justify; padding: 10px;"> From the piers of Seattle to the shores of the Philippines, Seattle&#8217s Best Coffee is exclusively run by Coffee Masters, Inc., which started operations in 2000 at a time where in Filipinos were ready for artisanal, perfectly blended, fresh coffee. Since then, SBC Philippines is now up to 50 stores nationwide and growing. </p>

			<p> <blockquote style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; ">Our story began in the 70s, when the Stewart Brothers started brewing bold, smooth coffee on Seattle&#8217s Pier 70. We were  then known as the <em> Wet Whisker</em>, and brewed our cups in a 12-lb peanut roaster. As our business grew, we decided to put ourselves to the test - entering a local taste test competition to find the best tasting coffee in Seattle.  Our bold, smooth tasting coffee won, and we then cheekily changed our name to <q> Seattle&#8217s Best Coffee </q>.

			<h3 style="color: #FEF6EB; font-family: arial; padding: 10px;"> <img src="seattle_about.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 10px;" width="500" id="history"> <i> history </i> </h3>
			<p style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; padding: 5px;"> Our story began in 1970, when brothers Jim and Dave Stewart opened their first ice cream and coffee shop - <em>the Wet Whisker</em> - on Whidbey Island, just northwest of Seattle, Washington. Jim started out sourcing green coffee beans from local growers, and it turned out that the brothers had a knack for brewing coffee as their business quickly outgrew their little peanut roaster. In a year&#8217s time, they opened another ice cream and coffee shop on Seattle&#8217s Pier 70 - this time called the Stewart Brothers&#8217 Wet Whisker. They started serving espresso, refining their brews out of their growing love of coffee, which was the backbone of their growing business. <br /> <br />



			At the turn of the 90s, the brothers put their best brew to the test when a local restaurant held a coffee-tasting competition to find <q>the best cup of coffee in Seattle.</q> Jim and Dave showcased their boldest, smoothest blend, and won. Soon after, Stewart Brothers&#8217 Coffee was renamed <q>Seattle&#8217s Best Coffee</q>, and they continued to expand globally, using nothing but the finest Arabica beans from around the world. <br /> <br />



			From Seattle&#8217s waterfront to the shores of Philippines, we at Coffee Master&#8217s Inc. continue Jim and Dave&#8217s mission - to deliver the bolder flavors that discerning consumers seek, as well as the smoother taste they prefer - because great coffee, a cozy atmosphere, and an intimate story bring out nothing but the best. <br /> <br />

			<p style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; padding: 5px;"> The Borders bookstore chain signed a contract with Seattle's Best Coffee in 2004 to convert Borders' in-store cafes to Seattle's Best cafes. By 2006, approximately two-thirds of Borders' domestic superstores had completed the Seattle's Best conversion. Seattle's Best parent company Starbucks Corporation has contracted with Borders' competitor Barnes & Noble to sell its products in Barnes and Noble's Cafes. (Borders has since completely shut down due to bankruptcy.) Starbucks also owns and operates locations within Chapters and Indigo Books and Music bookstores in Canada. Seattle's Best Coffee Cafes are found in larger JCPenney department stores when the company signed a contract in the late 1990s to have in-store caf√©s in department stores. <br /> <br />

			Seattle's Best Coffee Cafes and Kiosks can also be found on all 21 ships in the fleet of the cruise line Royal Caribbean International under the name "Latte-Tudes" or "Cafe Promenade". The presence of the Seattle's Best outlets on Royal Caribbean is also tied in with all other free-of-charge coffee items on the ship also being exclusively supplied by SBC. The Oasis class ships also have Starbucks outlet with the regular land price list, SBC is for-free (included in cruise cost). On February 16, 2010, Burger King announced that they would add Seattle's Best Coffee to their menu in over 7,000 restaurants. <br /> <br />

			On May 12, 2010, Starbucks announced a rebranding of Seattle's Best Coffee, with a new logo and plans to expand Seattle's Best Coffee distribution from 3,000 locations to 30,000 by the end of the 2010 fiscal year. The rebranding of the Seattle's Best Coffee logo from the detailed, vintage logo to the clinical, generic design for the new mass market was met with much criticism, with the new logo being likened to a label for eye-drops, a blood-bank sign and a gas station logo. <br /> <br />

			On February 8, 2011, Delta Air Lines and Seattle's Best entered into an agreement to offer Seattle's Best Coffee onboard all domestic, international, and Delta Connection flights beginning March 1, 2011. Since February 2015; however, Delta adjusted its coffee offerings in favor of Seattle's Best's parent company Starbucks on all flights. The Swedish fast food chain Max Hamburgers ended its partnership with Seattle's Best Coffee and discontinued serving their coffee on November 13th, 2019. </p>
